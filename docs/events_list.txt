Brand:\n● Clarifying your vision, mission, and values in a way that builds trust and sets you apart\n● How to position yourself for investors and customers from Day 1\n\n2. Customer Discovery:\n● Understanding intent and human behavior to identify your “Right Now” Customer\n● How to build marketing and product strategies around demand signals\n\n3. Channels & Traction:\n● Where to market when you don’t have money to waste\n● How to create credibility, validation, and traction investors want to see\n● Why founders must own the early-stage marketing story — and how to do it\n\nJoin us and get a practical, strategic foundation so you can approach marketing with the tactical understanding needed to attract users, generate revenue, and satisfy investor expectations — instead of relying on trial-and-error or burning through capital.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Here are a few things to know:\n\n​All founders in attendance will have raised some venture capital. \n\n​This is not a pitch event. I invited you because you are a serious, venture-scale founder. In my experience as a founder, the most valuable help most venture-scale founders find comes from other venture-scale founders and investors. My mission here is simply to make as many of these kinds of connections as I can.\n\n​To this end, everyone at the table will have the opportunity to introduce themselves and share a few words about what your startup does. Everyone should feel free also to make an ask or an offer (or both). \n\n​This breakfast gathering is only for founders and by invitation. Please do not bring uninvited guests. If you want to bring a co-founder or another founder, please just check with me first so we can be sure to have enough seating.\n\n​I look forward to meeting you!\n\n​Bob\n\n​About me. I am a 4x founder turned investor. I am the GP of Startup Haven Ventures, a pre-seed venture capital fund. In addition to direct investments, we also invest through our accelerator program. I founded the Startup Haven network in 2006 as a passion project to help build relationships between founders and investors. There are currently 2,300 founder and investor members. Membership is free. \n\n​Your RSVP is a commitment to attend this event. We are reserving your seat. If you need to cancel your RSVP, please try to let us know at least 48 hours in advance, thank you.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

At the same time, there's lots to take advantage of and reason to be optimistic. AI can supercharge one's career journey, tech education is shifting from one-size-fits-all programs to personalized curriculums, and there is more community in tech than ever before. So, how can the next wave of tech professionals look to their career futures?\n\nWe’ll unpack:\n🔹 How AI is changing job searches, skill-building, and career trajectories\n🔹 The future of tech education; degrees vs. programs vs. personalized learning\n🔹 What hiring managers are really looking for in 2025 and beyond\n🔹 How to navigate and personalize your own career journey in the age of AI\n\nOur amazing panelists are:\n⚪️ Yustina Saleh Ph.D - Managing Director, Burning Glass Institute\n⚪️ TeLisa Daughtry - Chief Innovation Officer, FLYX Labs\n⚪️ Cristina Costa - Certified Career & Leadership Coach\n⚪️ Jerlisa “Juju” Fontaine - Founder & CEO, HuCapital\n⚪️ Jessica Sepulveda - Full Stack Software Engineer, Former Educator\n\nAnd because community is the best way to level up, we’re turning up the energy with a networking mixer right after; your chance to meet panelists, fellow attendees, and the folks who are shaping the future of tech.\n\nSchedule:\n⚪ 6-615 PM - Welcome\n⚪ 615-715 PM - Future of Tech Education Panel\n⚪ 715-930 PM - Networking Mixer (w/ DJs, drinks, and dancing!)\n\nOur goal is for this event to not be just another tech event panel and mixer.

This event offers an in-depth exploration of the H-1B and O-1 visa categories, providing attendees with valuable insights into securing and maintaining these visas in today's dynamic environment.\n\nDiscussion Topics:\n\nH-1B Visa: Designed for workers in specialty occupations, the H-1B visa requires a higher education degree or its equivalent. It encompasses roles in fields such as IT, finance, engineering, and more.\n\nO-1 Visa: Intended for individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement in fields like sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, the O-1 visa recognizes those who have attained national or international acclaim.\n\nPanelists:\n\nSampei Omichi: A first-generation immigrant, Sampei avoided deportation by establishing a business within 60 days. He successfully raised over $6.5 million from investors, including Kindred Ventures and Balaji Srinivasan, to secure his U.S. residency by founding Ellis, a high-tech immigration law firm supporting startups and growing businesses.\n\nKelechi Onyeama: He is a 21-year-old Nigerian entrepreneur and self-taught app developer reshaping the future of digital communication. After moving from Nigeria to New York City with a dream and little more than determination, Kelechi built Social Wizard — an AI-powered app helping users navigate online conversations with confidence. Despite no formal training, no funding, and no team, he grew Social Wizard to over 400,000 downloads, earning more than $60,000 a month and $700,000 in total revenue. \n\nAmie Wiley: ​A first-generation immigrant from Ireland, Amie turned content creation into a full-time business. In addition to sharing her life on social media, she is the founder of Active With Amie, a coaching program that helps women struggling with their training, nutrition, and mindset.\n\nHugo Van Vuuren: Originally from South Africa, Hugo's immigration journey spans New Zealand and the United States. While in graduate school, he co-founded Work-Bench in NYC, an early-stage enterprise tech venture fund, and the Experiment Fund at Harvard. Currently, he co-leads Castle and actively assists fellow immigrants through The Parachute Project.\n\n\nWho Should Attend:\n\nInternational professionals seeking guidance on U.S. work visas.\n\nEntrepreneurs exploring visa options for business ventures.\n\nEmployers aiming to understand visa pathways for high-skilled talent.\n\n​Who are we?\n\nMAKING IN AMERICA: www.makinginamerica.org\n\n​Making It in America is a gathering of immigrant founders and creators who aspire to build companies, often facing logistical hurdles due to immigration issues. We are committed to guiding you in the right direction, connecting you with individuals who can provide letters of recommendation, linking you with potential employers, and serving as a sounding board for your ideas.\n\n​👋 This event is organized by Sagnik Basu, an immigrant entrepreneur currently working in news and co-founder of a production agency. Sagnik was born in India and sought education in the United Kingdom. He moved to the USA by himself in 2017 with $300, because he likes bigger portion sizes.\n\nHe believes in American dynamism and wants to support others who are building in the USA. This event represents the essence of creativity, advancement, and perseverance that propels the United States onward.\n\n​Needless to say, please come as you are.

At the AWS x Karini AI Executive Forum, you’ll be introduced to the Matriarchal AI Management (MAM) framework, the first governance model built specifically for generative AI agent ecosystems at enterprise scale.\n\nThis is not a conversation about ethics or future possibilities. It’s a working session for leaders who need operational control now. Enterprises are moving from managing code to managing autonomous systems, and traditional IT governance is already failing under that shift.\n\nThis forum brings together CIOs, CTOs, heads of AI and ML operations, and compliance officers facing regulatory scrutiny and real-time complexity. You’ll gain the tools to identify and control shadow agents, secure agent-to-agent interactions, and monitor the health of your AI ecosystem with precision. MAM equips you to lead with real-time observability, enforce policy, and scale safely.\n\nThe bottom line: unmanaged AI is a liability. MAM gives you the framework to take control. Attendance is limited to 20 senior leaders. Apply now before the room closes.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

This isn't just another marketing tactic—it's a completely different approach to creating momentum in a stalled growth environment.\n\nSpace is limited. The founders who attend will walk away with both the strategy and the tools to implement coordination-based marketing campaigns that actually move the needle.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Join us for an enlightening evening, bringing together thought leaders to explore how AI can unlock the structured knowledge of the Torah corpus, how Torah's comprehensive framework can transform our approach to AI, and how it all may herald humanity 2.0.\n\nThis interactive panel discussion challenges conventional narratives about AI, shifting from concern to empowerment, from redundancy to infinity, from quantity to quality, and from decentralization to emergent unity. Through the paradigm of Jewish philosophy, we'll explore how this collaboration can help reconcile human knowledge and model complex realities, and what the implications of the acceleration of information processing might mean to each individual.\n\nOur distinguished panelists will address provocative questions about the future of intelligence, ethics in an age of infinite perspective, and the unique position we occupy at this pivotal moment in history. The evening will include a moderated panel, audience Q&A, and opportunities to network under a philosophical and abstract banner; discussing the practical applications of what was very recently theoretical.\n\nPerfect for technologists, scholars, spiritual seekers, and anyone curious about how ostensibly niche wisdom, combined with modern technology, may mutually enhance each other for human flourishing.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Morgan Innovation Economy! \n\nIf you are a FOUNDER interested in PRESENTING, start here! (If you're just interested in attending, we'd love to see you at the Showcase! Just skip the next few paragraphs.)\n\nFOUNDERS: Welcome to what is set to be a highly anticipated event this New York Tech Week. The goal of this event is a pitch showcase that promotes mentorship for early-stage founders. Pre-seed and seed-stage startups in all industries are encouraged to participate!\n\nAll founders interested in presenting must fill out the four founder-specific questions in the questionnaire here on Partiful. Based off this questionnaire, a select group of founders will be selected as finalists for a mentorship round. These finalists will be presenting on June 3, and each finalist will be paired with one of the following mentors:\n\n🎤 David S. Rose (Managing Partner, Rose Tech Ventures and Founder & Chairman Emeritus, New York Angels)\n🎤 Norma A. Padrón, Ph.D. (Vice President, J.P. Morgan)\n🎤 David Kullmann (Venture Partner, Late Stage Capital)\n🎤 Kindra Tatarsky (Partner, Cerity Partners Ventures)\n🎤 René Bastón (Venture Partner, Covenant Venture Capital)\n🎤 David Attermann (Head of Web3 Investments, M31 Capital)\n\nWe will assign mentors two weeks prior to the Showcase date at the latest. Each of these mentors have already confirmed their capability to take on mentorship of multiple teams and connect with founders to review their pitch.\n\nSelected mentors will also be serving as judges on the big pitch showcase night!\n\nFOR NON-PRESENTING ATTENDEES:\n\nPlease RSVP, but no need for you to fill out the presenter-specific questions in the questionnaire of course!\n\nWhether you are a founder, investor, operator, or startup fanatic generally, we hope to see you live and in-person on Tuesday, June 3. Watch as 10-12 highly vetted startups present their companies to potential investors, corporate partners, and customers during New York Tech Week.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\n\n- Dynamic startup pitches from highly-vetted emerging entrepreneurs\n- Networking with investors, founders, and fellow tech enthusiasts\n- Light refreshments, food, and an energetic start to your Tuesday evening!\n\nDISCLAIMER: This pitch showcase is designed as a supportive platform for founders to receive valuable feedback and mentorship, rather than a traditional competition. While participants will benefit from expert guidance and networking opportunities within the VC ecosystem during the Showcase and the mentorship matching process, please note that no financial awards or monetary prizes will be presented as part of this event. The value for founders lies in the connections made at the Showcase, feedback received from mentors, and the opportunity to showcase their ventures to the broader New York Tech Week community. Additionally, no offer to invest in any of the founders participating in this Showcase at any stage is being made by any of the organizers, sponsors, supporters, judges, mentors, or attendees; neither is any offer for investment being solicited from the audience at the Pitch Showcase nor any member of the broader New York Tech Week community of attendees, sponsors, and affiliates.\n\nThis event is organized by Coeus Collective.\n\n🦉 Coeus Collective is a founder-powered media and community platform elevating the most innovative minds in entrepreneurship, technology, and venture capital. Through podcasts, events, and digital media storytelling, we help founders and VCs develop their audience of builders and innovators. Past events have featured Daniel Lubetzky (KIND Bars, Shark Tank), Michael Baum (Splunk), and Siya Raj Purohit (OpenAI).

These integrative approaches enable a hives relocation program (AMAZHONEY) in remote schools and critical regions, to better trace pollination patterns for researchers and stakeholders to pioneer strategies and translate climate assets for business resilience and biodiversity adaptation, replicating successful frameworks across the pollination production and supply chain to meet local and transnational development targets.\n\nFollowing presentations at Climate Week NYC and Davos World Biodiversity Forum, this session held by the Global Portal institute* will present the Polli-Tech sector and explore its respective leverages:\n- Comprehensive analytics on human-environment interactions forming the foundation of economy;\n- The effective scaling of critical resources through the latest legacy technological practices; \n- An innovative global Nest-Work mapping the sector to reinforce adaptive actions;\n- The implementation and monitoring existing of Queen Banks, and natural firewall for climate upheavals.\n\nAs Albert Einstein said: “The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.” This Tech Week 2025 is the perfect time to define avenues of technological commitments addressing issues that concern us all, for now and the generations to come. \n\n*The Global Portal Institute (GPI) is a research institution based between New York, the Amazon rainforest and Greece, providing up-to-date diagnoses of critical resources and new standards analysis, partnering with multiple centers/firms and agencies, such as The Port Global (www.theportglobal.com), to make tangible creative tech, both millenary and modern-day, to best streamline impact and dependencies of leading actors and clients on the field.\n\nFor more information, visit: www.globalportal.in.  \n\n---\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "While SEO is often treated as a technical afterthought, it’s actually a strategic powerhouse when it’s aligned with brand, content, and social. This panel will unpack how SEO doesn’t exist in a silo but thrives at the intersection of clear brand positioning, compelling content, and a consistent social presence. The session is designed to show founders and marketers how to stop treating SEO like a checklist and treat it like a growth engine that connects all marketing functions.\n\nDiscussion topics:\n* SEO as a strategic foundation: How keyword research can inform not just blog titles, but your brand language, content direction, and even product naming.\n* Brand strategy meets search: Why having a distinct voice and positioning makes your SEO efforts actually stick (aka: how to rank and be remembered).\n* Content that converts and climbs: The art of writing for people and search engines. Plus, the case for long-form, faceless videos, and how content strategy supports retention.\n* Social media as the amplifier: How social signals, shareable content, and micro-SEO moments on platforms like LinkedIn and TikTok drive discovery and build authority.\n* What startups get wrong (and how to fix it): Misaligned messaging, “too soon” SEO, or “just blogging”—the traps early-stage startups fall into and how to shift.\n\nGet your SEO and marketing questions answered, and connect with others who are building and scaling in the NY tech ecosystem\n\n\nKnow the Speakers:\n\n•\tLisandra de la Paz – Brand Strategy & Messaging\n\nFrom Univision to Droga5, Lisandra has helped shape how national brands and media connect with their audiences through story and strategy. Now as co-founder of Fluentica, she guides startups to go from generic to unforgettable through brand positioning that fuels growth.\n\n•\tAmy Perez – Marketer\n\nAmy is an intuitive problem solver with a wide range of experience—from grassroots nonprofits to B2B tech and B2C law. She specializes in building brands from the ground up. As co-founder of Fluentica, she’s focused on helping the next generation of bold brands thrive.\n\n•\tSabrina Ramos – Event Experience & Brand Activation\n\nFounder of Pop Spark, an experiential marketing agency that specializes in creating pop-up experiences for growing businesses that don't just introduce your brand to the world, but invite the audience to become part of your story.\n\n•\tNadya Ramos - Social Media Strategist\n\nShe’s a social media strategist who has launched campaigns generating thousands of impressions. She’s developed and hosted video content with a loyal Latino audience, co-scripted and hosted a TV special on CW Philly spotlighting Latino talent, and served as a spokesperson for clients on Spanish-language media.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

We’ll explore the new tools helping women understand their bodies- from biomarkers to blueprints, and the care models that reflect the way we actually live.\n\nIf you building in or are curious about women’s health, if you believe longevity should be intelligent and inclusive, if you’re ready to see what happens when data meets design with empathy—this is the room to be in.

    "description": "In 1961, JFK told the world we’d put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. In 1945, the Manhattan Project detonated the first atomic bomb. In 1999, two college kids launched Napster and cracked the music industry wide open. These were inconceivable futures—until they weren’t.\n\nToday, we stand at the edge of another one. AI is evolving faster than any tool humanity has ever created. But to power an AI future, we’ll need more than innovation—we’ll need infrastructure. Energy. Taste. Narrative. A new kind of imagination.\n\nJoin us for a BTS unlike anything else at New York Tech Week—hosted inside Poster House, the only museum in the country dedicated to the art and power of propaganda. Surrounded by the visual language of history’s most consequential messaging campaigns, we’ll explore the arms race in AI through the lens of its spiritual predecessors: the Cold War, the Space Race, and the myth of nuclear utopia.\n\nBTS is our traveling, closed-door series where creative leaders, technologists, and strategists go off-script to share the untold stories behind ambitious work. We’ve hosted 11 sessions in three countries—New York, San Francisco, and Toronto—welcoming more than 2,000 attendees. Every BTS follows Chatham House Rule, with a strict no-phone, no-photo, no-video policy—so people say what they really think. The result? Conversations that simply don’t happen anywhere else.\n\nWith special guests like Annie Jacobson, whose reporting on national security and nuclear history reads like science fiction, and Shawn Fanning, whose early bets on inconceivable futures helped reshape the internet, we’ll pull back the curtain on what’s coming—and what it takes to tell a story powerful enough to shape the future.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

We will not only discuss trends in direct-to-consumer experiences but also cover how various businesses have excelled in using IRL opportunities for customer activation or employee retention.   We will also discuss what it's like to fundraise in the space.  The night will end with time for networking with others passionate about the IRL Renaissance happening today.\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nRadha Agrawal: Co-founder & CEO of Daybreaker, the global morning dance, music and wellness movement with a community of half a million people. Radha is also an angel investor in mostly female owned businesses.\n\nJustin Bolognino: Pioneer in immersive experiences that fuse technology, design, and human connection. As the founder of META and Unreality, Justin and his team have crafted multi-sensory experiences for Spotify, Google, and Samsung in collaboration with artists like St. Vincent and Skrillex for Coachella and SXSW.\n\nVirginia Frischkorn: Founder & CEO of Partytrick, a software platform revolutionizing how experiences are planned, executed, and scaled through smart design and data-driven insights. Prior to Partytrick, Virginia spent 15 years as a luxury events planner and was recognized by Vogue and Martha Stewart Weddings as one of the top 50 planners in the world.\n\nIf you have any questions for the panelists, please send them in your RSVP and we will try to get to as many as we can at the end of the panel.

A strong pitch can lead to your next investor, a strategic partner, or even your first major customer. And at this year’s #NYTechWeek, Digitalundivided is creating the space for those moments to happen.\n\nWelcome to High-Velocity Investor Link — a fast-paced, high-stakes showcase for Seed and Series A founders ready to break through. Think speed dating, but for startups and the people who can help them grow: investors, industry experts, and startup ecosystem partners.\n\n🚀 Accelerated Access: The Pitch Experience\nEach selected founder will enter a lightning-round pitch circuit — three minutes to make their case to one of five curated investors or ecosystem leaders. Then, in just one powerful minute, that expert will deliver pointed, personalized feedback and make their call: Do they want to continue the conversation?\n\nThis is rapid connection with real outcomes.\n\n🎤 Post-Pitch Panel: Scaling Smart After the Raise\nAfter the pitch rounds, stick around for a candid panel conversation featuring investors and operators who’ve seen it all. They’ll unpack what it takes to grow after your first raise — and how to keep the momentum going when the spotlight fades.\n\n🤝 Purposeful Networking\nClose out the evening with meaningful networking over food and drinks. Build relationships with founders, investors, and innovation leaders who share your vision for what's possible.\n\nWant in?\nApply now to be considered for a pitching slot. Spots are limited and reserved for founders who are ready to scale and show up strong.\nNote: You must RSVP for the event and complete the CapXS application form (link above).\n\nThis is more than a showcase — it’s your shot to build something lasting.\n\nSpots are very limited, so don’t wait!\n\nThis event is part of #NYTechWeek – a week full of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech community.

Join us during New York Tech Week as Big Deals at Big Snow goes next level—more turns, more friends, and a whole lot more stoke.\n\n​We’ll kick things off with buses leaving Manhattan at 9am sharp (or you can drive yourself), landing us at Big Snow for two solid hours of skiing and riding from 10 to 12. Then we’ll shift into après lunch at noon, with two return buses heading back to the city at 12:30 and 1:30.\n\n​Whether you’re here to connect with other VCs and founders or just want to shred a few laps on North America’s only indoor snow dome, this one’s about community, conversation, and carving it up.\n\n​I’m Mike Ma, GP at Sidecut Ventures and former PSIA-AASI National Team Member. Snowboarding’s been a lifelong passion, and I’ll be out there riding with you—offering tips while listening to pitches, and soaking up the good vibes. Whether you're raising a round, looking to network (not at a bar!), jonesing for hot park laps, or just learning to link your first turns, you're in good company.\n\n​**** This is a FREE event, but due to the cost of the event, we are taking a $1 deposit. But due to the cost of this, if you no show, we are going to charge you for the full cost of the event ($150). It's all-inclusive—ski or snowboard, poles, boots, pants, jacket, and helmet are all provided, so no need to bring gear unless you want to. The only thing they don’t include are gloves, so feel free to bring your own or grab a cheap pair there.  So this isn't one of the NYTW events you can ghost.

    "description": "In the book \"The Silicon Boys: And Their Valley of Dreams\" the author states that he spoke to an accountant, a business professor, 2 VC financial officers and 3 investors in his fund and he is convinced that IRR cannot be explained in normal English.  \n\nWell look no further!  He never met the IRR Guru.   \n\nJoin her for this special event to educate the Private Capital Markets on one of IRRs 10+ years best kept secrets.  IRR, the topic of boredom for many people, will be reinvigorated by the IRR Gurus intriguing, fun/interesting take on the subject.  \"Let's face it, IRR is not exactly the most fun thing to talk about at a cocktail party.\" Says the IRR Guru.  \n\nAfter spending 10+ years in technology working with the largest LPs and GPs in the world managing over 4 trillion USD, the IRR Guru developed a host of proprietary IRR theories, calculations and performance attribution metrics to help the investment community gain deeper insights into their calculations.  \n\nThis session is for LPs, GPs, Family Offices, VCs and Angels and/or Accelerators that use metrics like IRR, MIRR, PME, MOIC and Time Zero IRR who want an intro into IRR Theory.  \n\nThe IRR Guru estimates 95% of attendees will walk away appreciating IRR like never before with a true foundation and better understanding of the calc.  \n\nSign up today to kick off New York Tech Week with the IRR Guru!\n\n*Please note this event touches on ai but is not a 100% ai event!\n*This event assumes a basic understanding of IRR and how to calculate in excel using the XIRR formula \n*This event is a zoom webinar (not regular zoom event) to allow LPs, PE firms and VC firms to attend in anonymity\n\n*A survey will be given at the end of the event to see if the 95% threshold is met\n*Connect with me or message me on linkedin with questions\nhttps://lnkd.in/eCbPRRhw\n\n*If you cannot make the 1pm session DM me and I can send you info on the 9pm replay session on the same day\n*The Guest List is being kept secret to keep the VCs, LPs, etc private \n\n*Follow the IRR Guru & DM her on x @theirrguru (her account is new so do follow/dm/engage) \n\nAbout IRR GURU: IRR Guru refers to herself as a calculation artist.  Reaching 2 Billion people over the last 5 years via tiktok, youtube and IG, she splits time her time between the arts, startups, vc and travel. \n\nShe is passionate about bringing her db IRR theory to the private equity/venture capital industry to help educate and demystify IRR.  \n\nPhoto credit: \nJoshua Sortino via Unsplash.com \n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "After working with 100’s of businesses to raise hundreds of millions in capital and through several exits we have seen how marketing can make or break a business. \n\nAll too often businesses get caught in the allure of simplicity in performance marketing only to fall into the same patterns of behavior that drives up costs, reduced profitability and ultimately leads to failure. \n\nJoin Bryan Karas, founder of Playbook Media & GrowTal, to get the ultimate crash course on the mistakes that kill businesses at all stages of business and the strategies you can implement to drive profitable growth for your business. \n\nIn this course we will cover the following topics with breakout sessions lead by guest CMO’s and heads of growth to provide tangible benefits that you can begin implementing in your business immediately. \n\nICP & Product-Market Fit: \nYour ICP defines who you’re targeting, and product-market fit means you're confirming that your product meets a specific need in your target market. Together, they ensure your marketing resonates, empathizes, and converts new users.\n\nMarginal returns and Avoiding the Waste of Averages: \nPerformance marketing offers immediate returns and easy attribution -- but's without assessing incrementality, it's often fool's gold that accelerates burn rate without adding much actual value. Make sure you're measuring what counts and optimizing your budget accordingly. \n\nPerformance Branding & True Emotional Connection: \nPerformance marketing drives action, but brand builds connection — and lasting growth happens when you combine both. To truly scale, you need more than optimized ads; you need an true emotional connection that makes people care, trust, and come back. The bonus: a strong brand is a growth moat your competitors can't easily overcome.\n\nHiring the Right People: \nPerhaps more than any of the above, hiring the wrong people at the wrong time is the kiss of death for startups. Different growth stages and challenges require different skills, and alignment is key to healthy growth.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.
