Whether you’re Seed or Series A, the path to scalable revenue and investor confidence is paved with smart, tested GTM moves—and this session gives you a rare chance to get real-time advice from those who’ve done it at the highest level.\n\nStartup-IQ’s Founders GTM Office Hours is not a panel, and it’s not a pitch competition. It’s a fast-moving, highly interactive session where you bring your toughest GTM questions—and get direct, no-fluff feedback from:\n\n-> Jack Nolan, a sales and GTM leader who’s built and scaled revenue engines across startups and global giants.\n\n-> Michael Queralt, a Y Combinator alum and founder who’s helped countless startups navigate funding, product-market fit, and sustainable growth.\n\nBut that’s not all—this format lets you learn from the challenges, insights, and strategies of your fellow founders. Hear what’s working (and what’s not), exchange ideas, and build tactical knowledge you can act on immediately.\n\nWhy This Matters:\nFounders ask. Founders learn. You’re not just listening—you’re participating.\n- Live, practical feedback on sales strategy, pricing, investor readiness, traction, and more.\n- Proven GTM frameworks you can plug into your startup right now.\n- Unfiltered insights from startup peers who are in the trenches with you.\n\nWhether you're still trying to validate your ICP or racing toward your next round, this is the room that will level up your GTM game.\n\nSpace is limited. Insights are not. Come ready. Leave sharper.\nLet’s get you growing.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Through the paradigm of Jewish philosophy, we'll explore how this collaboration can help reconcile human knowledge and model complex realities, and what the implications of the acceleration of information processing might mean to each individual.\n\nOur distinguished panelists will address provocative questions about the future of intelligence, ethics in an age of infinite perspective, and the unique position we occupy at this pivotal moment in history. The evening will include a moderated panel, audience Q&A, and opportunities to network under a philosophical and abstract banner; discussing the practical applications of what was very recently theoretical.\n\nPerfect for technologists, scholars, spiritual seekers, and anyone curious about how ostensibly niche wisdom, combined with modern technology, may mutually enhance each other for human flourishing.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.
