Join us for an enlightening evening, bringing together thought leaders to explore how AI can unlock the structured knowledge of the Torah corpus, how Torah's comprehensive framework can transform our approach to AI, and how it all may herald humanity 2.0.\n\nThis interactive panel discussion challenges conventional narratives about AI, shifting from concern to empowerment, from redundancy to infinity, from quantity to quality, and from decentralization to emergent unity. Through the paradigm of Jewish philosophy, we'll explore how this collaboration can help reconcile human knowledge and model complex realities, and what the implications of the acceleration of information processing might mean to each individual.\n\nOur distinguished panelists will address provocative questions about the future of intelligence, ethics in an age of infinite perspective, and the unique position we occupy at this pivotal moment in history. The evening will include a moderated panel, audience Q&A, and opportunities to network under a philosophical and abstract banner; discussing the practical applications of what was very recently theoretical.\n\nPerfect for technologists, scholars, spiritual seekers, and anyone curious about how ostensibly niche wisdom, combined with modern technology, may mutually enhance each other for human flourishing.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.
