This event offers an in-depth exploration of the H-1B and O-1 visa categories, providing attendees with valuable insights into securing and maintaining these visas in today's dynamic environment.\n\nDiscussion Topics:\n\nH-1B Visa: Designed for workers in specialty occupations, the H-1B visa requires a higher education degree or its equivalent. It encompasses roles in fields such as IT, finance, engineering, and more.\n\nO-1 Visa: Intended for individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement in fields like sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, the O-1 visa recognizes those who have attained national or international acclaim.\n\nPanelists:\n\nSampei Omichi: A first-generation immigrant, Sampei avoided deportation by establishing a business within 60 days. He successfully raised over $6.5 million from investors, including Kindred Ventures and Balaji Srinivasan, to secure his U.S. residency by founding Ellis, a high-tech immigration law firm supporting startups and growing businesses.\n\nKelechi Onyeama: He is a 21-year-old Nigerian entrepreneur and self-taught app developer reshaping the future of digital communication. After moving from Nigeria to New York City with a dream and little more than determination, Kelechi built Social Wizard — an AI-powered app helping users navigate online conversations with confidence. Despite no formal training, no funding, and no team, he grew Social Wizard to over 400,000 downloads, earning more than $60,000 a month and $700,000 in total revenue. \n\nAmie Wiley: ​A first-generation immigrant from Ireland, Amie turned content creation into a full-time business. In addition to sharing her life on social media, she is the founder of Active With Amie, a coaching program that helps women struggling with their training, nutrition, and mindset.\n\nHugo Van Vuuren: Originally from South Africa, Hugo's immigration journey spans New Zealand and the United States. While in graduate school, he co-founded Work-Bench in NYC, an early-stage enterprise tech venture fund, and the Experiment Fund at Harvard. Currently, he co-leads Castle and actively assists fellow immigrants through The Parachute Project.\n\n\nWho Should Attend:\n\nInternational professionals seeking guidance on U.S. work visas.\n\nEntrepreneurs exploring visa options for business ventures.\n\nEmployers aiming to understand visa pathways for high-skilled talent.\n\n​Who are we?\n\nMAKING IN AMERICA: www.makinginamerica.org\n\n​Making It in America is a gathering of immigrant founders and creators who aspire to build companies, often facing logistical hurdles due to immigration issues. We are committed to guiding you in the right direction, connecting you with individuals who can provide letters of recommendation, linking you with potential employers, and serving as a sounding board for your ideas.\n\n​👋 This event is organized by Sagnik Basu, an immigrant entrepreneur currently working in news and co-founder of a production agency. Sagnik was born in India and sought education in the United Kingdom. He moved to the USA by himself in 2017 with $300, because he likes bigger portion sizes.\n\nHe believes in American dynamism and wants to support others who are building in the USA. This event represents the essence of creativity, advancement, and perseverance that propels the United States onward.\n\n​Needless to say, please come as you are. You don't have to be an immigrant to register for this event. We welcome EVERYONE who believes in America, the spirit of entrepreneurship, and is ready to have a good time!\n\n🤝 Sponsors and Partners will be announced soon!\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "Come join the NYC Tech Eco-system for the 3rd Annual NYC Tech Week Soccer Championship!\n\n​Put on by Pitch on the Pitch and Kickoff FC, This game is open to ALL skill levels of soccer, but limited only to those operating as a Founder, VC, Operator, or Partner in the Tech NYC Ecosystem.\n\n​​The goal is to connect great people by having fun and building a more memorable bond together. If we can all help each other advance a professional goal (and score a goal on the pitch) - even better. \n\n​This event is a part of #TechWeek - a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.\n\n​The Agenda:\n\n​10am - 12pm: Soccer Games and Ask Session\n\n12pm - 1:30pm: Optional Brunch (space is limited)\n\n​We call it Soccer Networking: We're here to play and have fun, but also to do business. The structure of this game is for everyone to play soccer, and then we all make an ask in front of the group afterwards. We've done this before and have made 70+ introductions as a result. Why not bring the same energy to NYC Tech Week :)\n\n​​Game Format: We will play multiple games with 7 to 9 players per team\n\n​​What to Bring: Please bring turf shoes or even sneakers. Also depending on the weather, it is fine to wear shorts - or it is fine to wear sweatpants. Feel free to bring your own shin guards - but we seriously hope those aren't necessary.\n\n​​How long will we play for? The soccer is expected to last 90 - 120 minutes - with 30+ minutes of asks afterwards.\n\n​What's the main rule? This is a game to have fun and to network. Please show up to be awesome and fun to play with. No jerks or aggressive soccer playing allowed - your business and professional network counts on it.\n\n​​How to get there? Entrance to Bushwick Inlet part is at N9th St and Kent\n\n​​By Train: L to Bedford Top - Then walk 4 blocks towards the water and enter in at N9th St\n\n​​By Ferry: Take the East River Ferry to the North Williamsburg stop. Then walk 5 minutes to Kent and enter the part at N9th St\n\n​​By CitiBike: There is a station at N8th and Kent to park a bike\n\n​​Rideshare: Just tell them Bushwick Inlet Part\n\n​​This event is a part of #TechWeek - a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.\n\n​​More About Kickoff FC: Kickoff Futbol Club is a non-profit post-pandemic soccer club born out of Brooklyn, New York.\n\n​​We host organized pick-ups games, youth programming and competitive adult teams; serving as a liaison between local organizations, schools and communities tournaments and leagues. More information can be found here and their Instagram can be followed at Kickoff FC\n\n​More About Pitch on the Pitch: a regular soccer match based in Manhattan where we all come together to play soccer for 90 minutes and then take 30 minutes to make an ask in front of the group. This group was founded by Tim Frazier and Devin Keane and have so far made 70+ introductions as a result.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.
