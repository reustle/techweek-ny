Here are a few things to know:\n\n​All founders in attendance will have raised some venture capital. \n\n​This is not a pitch event. I invited you because you are a serious, venture-scale founder. In my experience as a founder, the most valuable help most venture-scale founders find comes from other venture-scale founders and investors. My mission here is simply to make as many of these kinds of connections as I can.\n\n​To this end, everyone at the table will have the opportunity to introduce themselves and share a few words about what your startup does. Everyone should feel free also to make an ask or an offer (or both). \n\n​This breakfast gathering is only for founders and by invitation. Please do not bring uninvited guests. If you want to bring a co-founder or another founder, please just check with me first so we can be sure to have enough seating.\n\n​I look forward to meeting you!\n\n​Bob\n\n​About me. I am a 4x founder turned investor. I am the GP of Startup Haven Ventures, a pre-seed venture capital fund. In addition to direct investments, we also invest through our accelerator program. I founded the Startup Haven network in 2006 as a passion project to help build relationships between founders and investors. There are currently 2,300 founder and investor members. Membership is free. \n\n​Your RSVP is a commitment to attend this event. We are reserving your seat. If you need to cancel your RSVP, please try to let us know at least 48 hours in advance, thank you.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

At the AWS x Karini AI Executive Forum, you’ll be introduced to the Matriarchal AI Management (MAM) framework, the first governance model built specifically for generative AI agent ecosystems at enterprise scale.\n\nThis is not a conversation about ethics or future possibilities. It’s a working session for leaders who need operational control now. Enterprises are moving from managing code to managing autonomous systems, and traditional IT governance is already failing under that shift.\n\nThis forum brings together CIOs, CTOs, heads of AI and ML operations, and compliance officers facing regulatory scrutiny and real-time complexity. You’ll gain the tools to identify and control shadow agents, secure agent-to-agent interactions, and monitor the health of your AI ecosystem with precision. MAM equips you to lead with real-time observability, enforce policy, and scale safely.\n\nThe bottom line: unmanaged AI is a liability. MAM gives you the framework to take control. Attendance is limited to 20 senior leaders. Apply now before the room closes.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Because it's not \"worth it.\" The risk is too high, the reward too uncertain. \n\nBut what if you knew you weren't alone? What if you knew exactly how many others would stand with you? \n\nThat's what Spartacus does. It builds the numbers. And numbers equal leverage. Protection. Impact. \n\nWhether you're building communities, organizing unions, gathering signatures, exposing corruption, fighting bullies, or starting a revolution within your organization—Spartacus makes taking action worth it. \n\nJoin us in NYC. Drinks on us. Bring your frustrations, your dreams, and your most provocative ideas about politics, activism, and tech. \nWe'll play a coordination game that will blow your mind, demo the platform that could change everything, and talk about the collective action problems facing humanity, including the ones YOU care about. \n\nThe powerful don't want you to have leverage.

Join us during New York Tech Week as Big Deals at Big Snow goes next level—more turns, more friends, and a whole lot more stoke.\n\n​We’ll kick things off with buses leaving Manhattan at 9am sharp (or you can drive yourself), landing us at Big Snow for two solid hours of skiing and riding from 10 to 12. Then we’ll shift into après lunch at noon, with two return buses heading back to the city at 12:30 and 1:30.\n\n​Whether you’re here to connect with other VCs and founders or just want to shred a few laps on North America’s only indoor snow dome, this one’s about community, conversation, and carving it up.\n\n​I’m Mike Ma, GP at Sidecut Ventures and former PSIA-AASI National Team Member. Snowboarding’s been a lifelong passion, and I’ll be out there riding with you—offering tips while listening to pitches, and soaking up the good vibes. Whether you're raising a round, looking to network (not at a bar!), jonesing for hot park laps, or just learning to link your first turns, you're in good company.\n\n​**** This is a FREE event, but due to the cost of the event, we are taking a $1 deposit. But due to the cost of this, if you no show, we are going to charge you for the full cost of the event ($150). It's all-inclusive—ski or snowboard, poles, boots, pants, jacket, and helmet are all provided, so no need to bring gear unless you want to. The only thing they don’t include are gloves, so feel free to bring your own or grab a cheap pair there.  So this isn't one of the NYTW events you can ghost.
