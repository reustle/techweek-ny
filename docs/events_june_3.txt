Just skip the next few paragraphs.)\n\nFOUNDERS: Welcome to what is set to be a highly anticipated event this New York Tech Week. The goal of this event is a pitch showcase that promotes mentorship for early-stage founders. Pre-seed and seed-stage startups in all industries are encouraged to participate!\n\nAll founders interested in presenting must fill out the four founder-specific questions in the questionnaire here on Partiful. Based off this questionnaire, a select group of founders will be selected as finalists for a mentorship round. These finalists will be presenting on June 3, and each finalist will be paired with one of the following mentors:\n\nüé§ David S. Rose (Managing Partner, Rose Tech Ventures and Founder & Chairman Emeritus, New York Angels)\nüé§ Norma A. Padr√≥n, Ph.D. (Vice President, J.P.

Each of these mentors have already confirmed their capability to take on mentorship of multiple teams and connect with founders to review their pitch.\n\nSelected mentors will also be serving as judges on the big pitch showcase night!\n\nFOR NON-PRESENTING ATTENDEES:\n\nPlease RSVP, but no need for you to fill out the presenter-specific questions in the questionnaire of course!\n\nWhether you are a founder, investor, operator, or startup fanatic generally, we hope to see you live and in-person on Tuesday, June 3. Watch as 10-12 highly vetted startups present their companies to potential investors, corporate partners, and customers during New York Tech Week.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\n\n- Dynamic startup pitches from highly-vetted emerging entrepreneurs\n- Networking with investors, founders, and fellow tech enthusiasts\n- Light refreshments, food, and an energetic start to your Tuesday evening!\n\nDISCLAIMER: This pitch showcase is designed as a supportive platform for founders to receive valuable feedback and mentorship, rather than a traditional competition. While participants will benefit from expert guidance and networking opportunities within the VC ecosystem during the Showcase and the mentorship matching process, please note that no financial awards or monetary prizes will be presented as part of this event. The value for founders lies in the connections made at the Showcase, feedback received from mentors, and the opportunity to showcase their ventures to the broader New York Tech Week community.

A new kind of imagination.\n\nJoin us for a BTS unlike anything else at New York Tech Week‚Äîhosted inside Poster House, the only museum in the country dedicated to the art and power of propaganda. Surrounded by the visual language of history‚Äôs most consequential messaging campaigns, we‚Äôll explore the arms race in AI through the lens of its spiritual predecessors: the Cold War, the Space Race, and the myth of nuclear utopia.\n\nBTS is our traveling, closed-door series where creative leaders, technologists, and strategists go off-script to share the untold stories behind ambitious work. We‚Äôve hosted 11 sessions in three countries‚ÄîNew York, San Francisco, and Toronto‚Äîwelcoming more than 2,000 attendees. Every BTS follows Chatham House Rule, with a strict no-phone, no-photo, no-video policy‚Äîso people say what they really think. The result? Conversations that simply don‚Äôt happen anywhere else.\n\nWith special guests like Annie Jacobson, whose reporting on national security and nuclear history reads like science fiction, and Shawn Fanning, whose early bets on inconceivable futures helped reshape the internet, we‚Äôll pull back the curtain on what‚Äôs coming‚Äîand what it takes to tell a story powerful enough to shape the future.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

The more our lives move online and our interactions get mediated by machines, the more we miss and crave physical interactions with other humans and the world around us.\n\nThis is why we are so excited to bring a unique panel of founders building in the experiential economy space to Tech Week to discuss what they are building, current trends, pitfalls and opportunities in the space, and where they see the space going in the next decade.  We will not only discuss trends in direct-to-consumer experiences but also cover how various businesses have excelled in using IRL opportunities for customer activation or employee retention.   We will also discuss what it's like to fundraise in the space.  The night will end with time for networking with others passionate about the IRL Renaissance happening today.\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nRadha Agrawal: Co-founder & CEO of Daybreaker, the global morning dance, music and wellness movement with a community of half a million people. Radha is also an angel investor in mostly female owned businesses.\n\nJustin Bolognino: Pioneer in immersive experiences that fuse technology, design, and human connection. As the founder of META and Unreality, Justin and his team have crafted multi-sensory experiences for Spotify, Google, and Samsung in collaboration with artists like St. Vincent and Skrillex for Coachella and SXSW.\n\nVirginia Frischkorn: Founder & CEO of Partytrick, a software platform revolutionizing how experiences are planned, executed, and scaled through smart design and data-driven insights. Prior to Partytrick, Virginia spent 15 years as a luxury events planner and was recognized by Vogue and Martha Stewart Weddings as one of the top 50 planners in the world.\n\nIf you have any questions for the panelists, please send them in your RSVP and we will try to get to as many as we can at the end of the panel.

    "description": "After working with 100‚Äôs of businesses to raise hundreds of millions in capital and through several exits we have seen how marketing can make or break a business. \n\nAll too often businesses get caught in the allure of simplicity in performance marketing only to fall into the same patterns of behavior that drives up costs, reduced profitability and ultimately leads to failure. \n\nJoin Bryan Karas, founder of Playbook Media & GrowTal, to get the ultimate crash course on the mistakes that kill businesses at all stages of business and the strategies you can implement to drive profitable growth for your business. \n\nIn this course we will cover the following topics with breakout sessions lead by guest CMO‚Äôs and heads of growth to provide tangible benefits that you can begin implementing in your business immediately. \n\nICP & Product-Market Fit: \nYour ICP defines who you‚Äôre targeting, and product-market fit means you're confirming that your product meets a specific need in your target market. Together, they ensure your marketing resonates, empathizes, and converts new users.\n\nMarginal returns and Avoiding the Waste of Averages: \nPerformance marketing offers immediate returns and easy attribution -- but's without assessing incrementality, it's often fool's gold that accelerates burn rate without adding much actual value. Make sure you're measuring what counts and optimizing your budget accordingly. \n\nPerformance Branding & True Emotional Connection: \nPerformance marketing drives action, but brand builds connection ‚Äî and lasting growth happens when you combine both. To truly scale, you need more than optimized ads; you need an true emotional connection that makes people care, trust, and come back. The bonus: a strong brand is a growth moat your competitors can't easily overcome.\n\nHiring the Right People: \nPerhaps more than any of the above, hiring the wrong people at the wrong time is the kiss of death for startups. Different growth stages and challenges require different skills, and alignment is key to healthy growth.\n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.
