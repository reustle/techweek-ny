He never met the IRR Guru.   \n\nJoin her for this special event to educate the Private Capital Markets on one of IRRs 10+ years best kept secrets.  IRR, the topic of boredom for many people, will be reinvigorated by the IRR Gurus intriguing, fun/interesting take on the subject.  \"Let's face it, IRR is not exactly the most fun thing to talk about at a cocktail party.\" Says the IRR Guru.  \n\nAfter spending 10+ years in technology working with the largest LPs and GPs in the world managing over 4 trillion USD, the IRR Guru developed a host of proprietary IRR theories, calculations and performance attribution metrics to help the investment community gain deeper insights into their calculations.  \n\nThis session is for LPs, GPs, Family Offices, VCs and Angels and/or Accelerators that use metrics like IRR, MIRR, PME, MOIC and Time Zero IRR who want an intro into IRR Theory.  \n\nThe IRR Guru estimates 95% of attendees will walk away appreciating IRR like never before with a true foundation and better understanding of the calc.  \n\nSign up today to kick off New York Tech Week with the IRR Guru!\n\n*Please note this event touches on ai but is not a 100% ai event!\n*This event assumes a basic understanding of IRR and how to calculate in excel using the XIRR formula \n*This event is a zoom webinar (not regular zoom event) to allow LPs, PE firms and VC firms to attend in anonymity\n\n*A survey will be given at the end of the event to see if the 95% threshold is met\n*Connect with me or message me on linkedin with questions\nhttps://lnkd.in/eCbPRRhw\n\n*If you cannot make the 1pm session DM me and I can send you info on the 9pm replay session on the same day\n*The Guest List is being kept secret to keep the VCs, LPs, etc private \n\n*Follow the IRR Guru & DM her on x @theirrguru (her account is new so do follow/dm/engage) \n\nAbout IRR GURU: IRR Guru refers to herself as a calculation artist.  Reaching 2 Billion people over the last 5 years via tiktok, youtube and IG, she splits time her time between the arts, startups, vc and travel. \n\nShe is passionate about bringing her db IRR theory to the private equity/venture capital industry to help educate and demystify IRR.  \n\nPhoto credit: \nJoshua Sortino via Unsplash.com \n\nThis event is a part of #NYTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.
